`Typers` is a very simple console application that implements using a pen and a watercolor as follows:
+ Pen has ink value of `20`. For each typed symbol one "ink" is used. If the remaining ink is `3` and the world `hello` is entered the app will only
return only `hell`, saying that there was ink only for the first `3` symbols.
+ The Watercolor has ink value of `10`. If vowel is entered - `-2` ink, if other - `-1` ink
